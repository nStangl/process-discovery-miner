# Use the following to automatically copy your bundle upon creation via `yesod
# keter`. Uses `scp` internally, so you can set it to a remote destination
# copy-to: user@host:/opt/keter/incoming/

# You can pass arguments to `scp` used above. This example limits bandwidth to
# 1024 Kbit/s and uses port 2222 instead of the default 22
# copy-to-args:
#   - "-l 1024"
#   - "-P 2222"
